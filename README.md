# Music Library Tools

A small collection of utilities for maintaining and inspecting a music library

These tools focus on file hygiene, metadata cleanup, and release validation.
They are designed to operate on audio files and do not depend on any 
specific playback server.

- [Scene Tools](scene/README.md)

## Philosophy

Scriptable tools to check and verify audio files in your library

## Requirements

Most tools are written as shell scripts and assume:
- Linux environment
- Common CLI tools (bash, find, grep, etc.)
- metaflac (for FLAC operations, if used)

## Usage

Each subdirectory contains its own README with details and examples.
